# Parachute Drop Contract for HackAtom Seoul 2022
## Purpose
* It’s an airdrop platform **running on Evmos** purposed to enhance economic sustainability for DAOs and projects.
* Make people delegate their voting power to various members. (in case of governance token)

## Problem
* More and more projects are using an airdrop to distribute their tokens and start their token economy. 
* However, you cannot perfectly identify and exclude people from airdrop who are willing to sell their tokens. 
* Selling airdropped tokens in a short term could damage the sustainability of projects and distort the token economy. 
* Also, many DAOs and projects make token receivers delegate their voting powers during the airdrop process. But receivers won’t change their delegation and neglect it.

## Solution
* We suggest 4 main features to solve the problems:
1. Divide airdrop into 10 ~ 15 rounds with intervals for 3 or 6 months b/w each rounds. (1 week for each round)
2. You must delegate your token before receiving airdrops. (in case of governance token)
3. DAO/projects would check whether airdrop receivers have sold their tokens or not when the next round has begun. 
4. Receivers would get token proportionate to amounts of tokens they have been holding during the interval, and delegate its token to another one. (in case of governance token)
